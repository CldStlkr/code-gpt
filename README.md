# Code-GPT: Revolutionizing Rust Development with AI Automation

Welcome to Code-GPT, a venture into the melding of AI and software development, focusing on the Rust programming language. This project embodies my vision of utilizing GPT-powered AI to redefine the coding landscape, making it more efficient, robust, and accessible to developers worldwide. Code-GPT is not just a tool; it's a testament to the future of automated software engineering, where AI agents write, test, and debug code autonomously.

## Project Essence

At its core, Code-GPT leverages specialized AI agents to automate various aspects of the software development process. These agents are tasked with generating Rust code based on specific requirements, executing this code, and verifying its correctness. Should any issues arise, the agents iteratively refine and test the code until it meets all criteria.

The flagship capability of Code-GPT is an AI agent designed to construct a web server from a given template entirely in Rust. This demonstrates not only the potential of AI in automating development tasks but also highlights Rust's advantages, such as its performance and safety features.

### Features at a Glance:

- **Automated Rust Development**: Utilize AI to streamline the coding process, making development faster and more reliable.
- **Custom AI Agents**: Explore the forefront of AI technology by creating agents capable of writing and testing Rust code.
- **Rust and AI Integration**: Dive deep into Rust, leveraging its features to interact with cutting-edge AI APIs like GPT-4.
- **Hands-On Learning Experience**: Build a fully functional web server as a practical application of the concepts learned.

## Why I Created Code-GPT

My motivation behind developing Code-GPT was to bridge the gap between AI technology and software development, particularly in Rust. With the rapid advancements in AI and machine learning, I saw an opportunity to enhance the development process, making it not only faster but also more reliable. Code-GPT represents a leap towards a future where developers can focus on creative and complex tasks while AI handles the more mundane or repetitive aspects of coding.

## How It Works

Code-GPT is built around the concept of AI-driven development automation. It involves several key components:

- **OpenAI and GPT-4 API Integration**: Leverage the capabilities of GPT-4 to understand and process development tasks.
- **Rust Language Proficiency**: Utilize Rust's features to their fullest, ensuring that the code generated is efficient, safe, and scalable.
- **AI Functions Development**: Create specialized functions that command the AI to perform specific coding tasks, from generating code snippets to testing them.
- **Web Server Template Development**: Use Actix Web to design and implement a template for the web server, which serves as the foundation for the AI's code generation.

## Future Improvements

In the future, I intend to add full front-end functionality, dynamic api calls and a custom GPT agent that is trained solely on website code, both front and backend.

## Acknowledgments

Thank you to OpenAI for making the GPT-4 API accessible, enabling this exploration into AI-driven development. I also want to thank the Rust community for their resources and support, which have proved invaluable in the creation of this project.
